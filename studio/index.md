# Mathigon Studio

Mathigon Studio is an award-winning platform for creating interactive, online courses! The
[@mathigon/studio](https://github.com/mathigon/studio) repository is not intended to be used
standalone. You will need to create a parent repository  containing the content, settings, and any
customisations for this course. You can see a sample implementation in the
[docs/example](https://github.com/mathigon/studio/tree/main/docs/example) folder. Then install
Mathigon Studio as a dependency using `npm install @mathigon/studio`.
